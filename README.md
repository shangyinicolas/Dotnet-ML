# Sentiment Analysis Model

This repository contains a simple sentiment analysis model implemented in C# using the MyMLApp library.

## Overview

The sentiment analysis model is trained to predict whether a given text expresses a positive or negative sentiment. The model has been trained using sample data, and this README provides instructions on how to use the model in your own applications.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Before using the sentiment analysis model, ensure that you have the following installed:

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-repository
    ```

3. Open the `Program.cs` file in your preferred C# development environment.

4. Replace the sample input data with your own text:

    ```csharp
    var sampleData = new SentimentModel.ModelInput()
    {
        Col0 = "Your text here."
    };
    ```

5. Run the program to predict the sentiment:

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

   The program will output the predicted sentiment based on the provided text.
